{
    "id": either "private" WITH QUOTES / or just the number without them,
    "name": just the name of the level with quotes
    "author": hosts name with quotes
    "creators": just keep this as it is in the template
    "verifier": verifier name in quotes
    "isVerified": either false or true with no quotes
    "verification": youtube link in quotes, put ONLY IF VERIFIED
    "showcase": youtube link in quotes of the latest FULL PREVIEW, dont put single deco parts here

}

// LAST UPDATE: DD.MM.YYYY <--- change this to todays date when there's new prog on the level (even just info from the host)

IMPORTANT: AFTER EACH LINE (except tags and those things: [] {} ) KEEP A COMMA

HOW TO FILL RECORDS AND RUNS:

    "records/run depending on which one it is": [
        {
            "user": "none",
            "link": "",
            "percent": 0,
            "hz": 0
        }
    ],

where:
- IF THE WR IS 0% YOU LEAVE IT AS IT IS
- in user you put the name of the WR inside quotes
- in link you paste a YT link for their WR in quotes (if none paste "#")
- IN RECORDS (from zero) in percent you put one integer with no quotes which is the current WR FROM ZERO
- IN RUNS (from startpos) you put the WR run in quotes, for example: "14-78"
- in hz you put the hz that the record was done in as an int with no quotes

HOW TO FILL TAGS:

example: "tags": ["long", "nong", "remake"]
so, you put square brackets and inside them all tags in quotes in lowercase with commas between them

ALL TAGS (THEY ARE CASE SENSITIVE): 
Public - "Public" - the level is uploaded publicly on the gd servers
Finished - "Finished" - the level is fully finished
Being Verified - "Verifying" - the level has sugnificant verification prog (30%+ runs)
Layout State - "Layout" - the level doesnt have any deco prog
Unrated - "Unrated" - the level is verified but not rated
Rated - "Rated" - ...
Medium - "Medium" - the level is less than a minute long
Long - "Long" - the level is 60-120 seconds long
XL - "XL" - the level is 120-180 seconds long
XXL+ - "XXL" - ...
NC Level - "NC" - ...
Remake - "Remake" - the level is a remake of another level
Uses NoNG - "NONG" - ...
Top Quality - "Quality" - the level is insanely high quality (like legenday-mythic qual)
You can put a tag in with whatever you want (like "weofijwe" would display correctly), however it wont show up in the filter section because that isn't coded in - Luke
